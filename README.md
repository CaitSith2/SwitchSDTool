# SwitchSDTool

This is a tool used to dump NSP files from the games/dlc/updates you legitimately obtained from the e-shop. This is done through obtaining a nand backup via [hekate](https://github.com/CTCaer/hekate/), the required console specific keys via [biskeydump](https://github.com/rajkosto/biskeydump) from your switch, along with other keys via [kezplez](https://github.com/tesnos/kezplez-nx) needed for [hactool](https://github.com/SciresM/hactool). It also requires [googling](https://www.google.com/ "Hoping kezplez eventually supports retrieving this") for eticket_rsa_kek. For minimal ban risk,  Delete your wifi connection profiles, put your switch into airplane mode,  *BACKUP YOUR NAND*, run biskeydump, follow the instructions for running kezplez to get keys.txt, *RESTORE YOUR NAND*. At the end of this, you will then need [hac disk mount](https://switchtools.sshnuke.net/) to dump PRODINFO.bin, and mount the SYSTEM partition.
